704. Binary Search

Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 < nums[i], target < 104
All the integers in nums are unique.
nums is sorted in ascending order.

Hints
We can use a binary search algorithm to solve this problem. The idea is to find the middl
element of the array and compare it with the target. If the target is equal to th
element, then we have found the target. If the target is less than the element,
then we can discard the right half of the array. If the target is greater than th
element, then we can discard the left half of the array. We repeat this process
until we find the target or we have discarded all elements of the array.
